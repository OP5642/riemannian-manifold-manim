# Intuition behind Riemannian manifolds

This is a short ``manim`` project demonstrating intuition behind how and why Riemannian manifolds are defined the way they are.

The project is a part of my semester project for the course: Teaching Methodology in Mathematics and Computer Science, held at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics.
